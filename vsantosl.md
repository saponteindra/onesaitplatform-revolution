# What i think about the initiative:
I think that develop software as a open source project, is a excellent idea, many successful project's are open source.
# Why i'm participating:
A year's goal of mine is to contribute to a open source project, and this project has so many new technologies,
of which i would like to learn, so i find this is a great opportunity.
