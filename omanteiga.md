# About the initiative

The initiative of creating an in-company open source platform and community sounds somehow exciting yet a little unspecific. 

I think this "revolutionary" competition is a clever idea to attract in-house developers.


# Why participating?

I want to participate because I like programming challenges and I am deeply interested in developing solutions with some of the technologies mentioned on the platform's page.
